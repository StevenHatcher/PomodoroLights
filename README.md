Pomodoro Timer Light
====================

#### Stay focused without overworking yourself by following the Pomodoro study method - guided by the height and color of the light.

Overview
--------

This Arduino Uno driven project projects a vertical light on the wall, displaying one of the two Pomodoro study method's states: Studying/Working or Resting. The color of the light changes based on the current state, and the height of the light changes based on the time remaining in the current state. This project is designed to offer a "stylish" and functional method of keeping yourself on track while studying.

Functionality
-------------

### States

The 25-minute Studying state displays a warm, fiery orange to keep you at peace while you study.

The 10-minute Resting state displays a deep blue.

The lights cycle between these states until the lights or the microcontroller are turned off.

### Height and Color

The core principle behind this project is to be able to gather all needed information about the current state at a glance. Even out of the corner of your eye, you are able to see the color and height of the light, and know what state you are in & how how much time remains for that state.
